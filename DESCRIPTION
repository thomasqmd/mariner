Description: Provides a set of functions to simplify and automate the
    process of rendering and packaging R Markdown documents. The package
    allows users to generate multiple reports from a single parameterized
    template and to bundle R Markdown files along with their outputs, such
    as PDFs, TeX files, and purled R scripts, into a single, easily
    shareable zip archive.
