# --- Setup: Create a temporary directory and generate multiple Rmd files ---
temp_dir <- tempfile("example-")
dir.create(temp_dir)

report_params <- tidyr::expand_grid(a = 1, b = 1:3, author = "Dr. Lastname")

# `generate_reports` returns a vector of paths to the created Rmd files.

# --- Example: Process the generated Rmd files into zip bundles ---
process_files(rmd_files_to_bundle)

# --- View the created files ---
# The directory contains the source Rmd files and their corresponding zips.
